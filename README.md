# When Harry Met Sally Sam Sammy Samuel Sandie Sandra Sandy Sara Sarah Sascha...

By [Allison Parrish](https://www.decontextualize.com/)

For [NaNoGenMo 2019](http://nanogenmo.github.io), I sorted many thousands of
sentences from Wikipedia plot summaries of romantic comedies. [Read the result
here](output.pdf) (PDF, 1500pp). A [plain text version](output.txt) is also
available.

A warning about the text: I have not meaningfully filtered the output of this
code, so the appropriateness of its contents draws purely from Wikipedia's
editorial guidelines. For this reason, I consider the text to be a kind of
"documentary artifact" rather than a finished piece. Please read with this in
mind!
