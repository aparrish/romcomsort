    "Quick project to get the juices flowing for [NaNoGenMo 2019](https://nanogenmo.github.io/). Using [this notebook](https://github.com/aparrish/corpus-driven-narrative-generation/blob/master/creating-a-wikiplots-subcorpus.ipynb), I created a text file with many thousands of sentences from plot summaries of romantic comedies on Wikipedia. (Thank you [WikiPlots](https://github.com/markriedl/WikiPlots) for making it fast and easy to construct this corpus!) In an effort to better understand the structure of the romantic comedy, I decided to introduce my own structure, i.e., sorting the sentences alphabetically, just to see what would happen. This is the result!\n",

      "Trip emphasizes how he dumped his girlfriend in the same fashion that Mike did to score with women and was unsuccessful. Tripp (Matthew McConaughey), a 35-year-old man, is still living with his parents Al (Terry Bradshaw) and Sue (Kathy Bates), in Baltimore. Tripp angrily confronts his parents, and breaks up with Paula. Tripp's best friends Demo (Bradley Cooper) and Ace (Justin Bartha) are also still living in their parents' homes and seem proud of it. Tripp's parents and friends devise a plan to reconcile the two lovers. Trish rushes to him in concern, and he finally confesses to her that he is a virgin. Trish's jealous TV-star husband crashes the wedding and gets into a fight with Ulysses. Trouble develops. Trouble is, Tod's been romantically involved with Betty Gilbert, a nightclub singer, while Gert's gotten engaged to Tod's football rival, Andy Mason. Troy Bolton is still dating Gabriella Montez, who decides to stay in Albuquerque with her mother. Troy agrees to sing with his friends in the show (\"You Are The Music In Me\"), not knowing that Sharpay is vying for his attention. Troy and Gabriella appear during the second half of the show and sing their duet together. Troy and Gabriella both win their respective competitions and the entire school gathers in the gym to celebrate (\"We're All In This Together\"). Troy and Gabriella rush to help her, and they sing together as Kelsi plays piano (\"What I've Been Looking For (Reprise)\"). Troy and Gabriella rush to the auditorium, and Sharpay and Ryan finish performing their song (\"Bop to the Top\"), confident that their plan worked. Troy and Gabriella's relationship is strained when Troy sees Ryan with Gabriella, sparking jealousy. Troy and Lelaina reunite and make amends after Troy returns from his father's funeral in Chicago. Troy arrives at Mike's apartment after finding out Mike got him his police job. Troy befriends and confides in them that he has slept with both women and men, but is reluctant to embrace any gay feelings. Troy continues to worry about funding for college. Troy eventually decides to look for a summer job to gain money for college. Troy eventually succumbs to Marc's advances during Gwen's homoerotic photo shoot, and the two fool around, but Marc cannot go through with it because he still has feelings for Kyle. Troy goes to Gabriella's house and they reconcile. Troy is confused because he did not apply to Juilliard.\n"
